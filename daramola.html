I will be interviewing my grandpa and grandma from my mom side where Nicaragua. 
My grandparents only speak spanish so i will be interviewing.<br />
<b>Interviewer:</b> Grandpa and grandma can you please introduce yourself.
<b>Intervey:</b> You already know our names *Both of them laugh*<br />
<b>Interviewer:</b>Yes i do but it is for my history class project please grandpa. 
<b>Intervey:</b>Okay mija. My name is Armando Ramirez.
<b>Intervery:</b> And my name is Haydee Ramirez. <br /> 
<b>Interviewer:</b> Can you please tell me where you guys are born?<br />
<b>Intervery (Armando):</b> I was born in Matagalpa in Nicaragua.<br  />
<b>Intervery (Haydee):</b> I was born in Leon in also Nicaragua.<br />
<b>Interviewer:</b> Grandma can you please tell me how was your childhood? I would like to hear more about it.<br  />
<b>Intervery(Haydee):</b> Ohh my childhood… well it was very hot where i live. It was about 90 degrees and oh my at night it was about 104 or the luckiest is 60 degrees but that is just if we are lucky, but growing up with my sister and my parents were very amazing times, we weren’t the riches but not the poorest… it was just so nice playing outside playing dolls or going down to the river to catch a cold swim.<br  />
<b>Interviewer:</b>That sounds amazing, i wished i could live in your time not worrying about drama or technology. But grandpa i have a question… what was the most important lesson that you have learned.<br   />
<b>Intervery(Armando):</b> That is a very hard question. It is probably that my dad has told me when i was 17 years old. He said “Someone who never leaves when you hit a bump in the road. Doesn’t leave when they yell at you.Doesn’t leave when they put a hand on you… they just simply doesn’t leave when it is so right that you can’t find another just like that one. That person stays fighting for your attention. Chooses to stay every night. To hear you out to the good or the bad is the person that you need.”<br />
<b>Interviewer:</b>Wow…*wipes a tear away* Thank you so much grandpa. Can you please tell me about the deepest moment that you have remembered. <br  />
<b>Interviewer:</b> As a little child i remembered that you grandpa would tell me all this wonderful stories that you would tell me that how you would met your first wife than your you met the beautiful woman who is right next to you.<br  />
<b>Intervery(Armando):</b> I was really young around 17 years old the nicaraguan war which was incredibly horrible… my family had no idea what to do so we stay put in our small little house. But one night there was gunshots coming threw the side of the house in the middle of dinner, we all screamed will my father grabbed his gun from the cabinet.We were so scared… i really thought was going to be the last night i will be alive so i did a little pray even if  i don’t believe in god.<br  />
<b>Interviewer:</b> How did you get out of there? It was seemly impossible to get out.<br />
<b>Intervery(Armando):</b> It was really hard to get out. But i remembered that if you join them your family can be safe and hopefully go to America so i packed my bags along my family. The day came so we saldy drift apart but as i was getting my gun that they handed to everyone i would hide food down my pants or shirts so when i do leave i would have food.<br />
<b>Interviewer:</b>Thank you for answering my questions!<br   />
<b>Intervery(Both):</b>No problem mija.<br   />
