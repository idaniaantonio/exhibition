<b>Layered subject Portrait Reflection</b>
     <b> How did i put all the pictures together? It was pretty difficult to be honest. How can I put something has so much meaning into pictures cramb up? It took time to find the right image but when I finally figured out what goes with what like the background of my grandparents story and what a little meaning was actually something so big, every image I have posted on my photoshop means something like I said above. Nicaragua flag and the wonderful beach and volcano that shows where my grandparents lived right next to each other but yet so far, the red flower that shows the love between them and the pain they have been through just to go to America.</b> 
    Yes the pictures might looked somewhat messy but each picture has it place. Like going in order to show the time lapse of what is going on in their lives, itâ€™s placed messy since a lot has happened. You might see that some images are larger than others since smaller has not as much meaning like big images that has impacted them.<br   />
